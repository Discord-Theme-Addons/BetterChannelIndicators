# v1.3.0
Big changes.
- Rewroe everything in SCSS, better maintainability and better for my sanity.
- Support for BetterDiscord, Vizality and Web.

# v1.2.0
Changed back to using the `::before` pseudo element. This change is from if you were to round the entire thing it would look a little off. It still will, but it wont be *as bad*.

# v1.1.1
Fix for Discord changing channel element.

# v1.1.0
Changed from using a `::before` pseudo element to using `box-shadow: inset;`. This removed customability, but I doubt anyone used this feature anyways.

# v1.0.1
Fixed channel and avatar positioning.

# v1.0.0
Inital creation.
