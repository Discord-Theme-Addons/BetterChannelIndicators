# v1.3.0
Rewrote in SCSS as well as added support for BetterDiscord, Vizality and Web.

# v1.2.0
Back to using pseudo elements because if you were to round the entire thing it would look kind of weird (still does but it shouldn't be as bad).

# v1.1.1
Fix because Discord changed every element for channels.

# v1.1.0
Changed from using a `::before` pseudo element to `box-shadow: inest;` This removed more customability (which I doubt anyone used anyways lol).

# v1.0.1
Fixed positioning for private channel and avatar.

# v1.0.0
Initial repo creation.
